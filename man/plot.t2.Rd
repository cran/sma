\title{Diagnostic Plots for Two-Sample t-statistics}

\description{
Plots of two-sample t-statistics, |t-numerator| and
t-denominator against average A, and plot of |t-numerator| against
t-denominator. For each spot on a given slide, \eqn{A = log_2
\sqrt{RG}}{A = log_2(R*G)/2}, where (R,G) denotes the red and green
fluorescence intensity pair. Points with t-statistics exceeding user
defined thresholds are highlighted. 
} 

\usage{
plot.t2(X, main.title="T plots", low=-5, high=5)
}

\arguments{

 \item{X}{output from the function \code{\link{stat.t2}}.}

 \item{main.title}{title for the plot.}

 \item{low}{lower threshold for t-statistic: points with t<low are
 colored in green.} 

 \item{high}{upper threshold for t-statistic: points with t>high are
 colored in red.} 
}

\title{Adding Information to a Data Structure for Multi-slide
Microarray Experiments} 

\description{
  Interactive function which adds other information generated from the
  output of image analysis software for microarrays to the existing 
  data structure created using  \code{\link{init.data}}.  
}

\usage{
init.addinfo(batch, attri, dataname=NULL, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{batch}{Character string, this refers to the name of a
  collection of experiments.} 
  \item{attri}{Character string, the name of the information to be
    included in the data structure.  For example, from the output of
    \tt{Spot}, this argument can be "area", "signal to noise" etc.
    In other words, these are the column headings from the raw data set.}
    \item{dataname}{A name of your experimental data.  By default it's
      named "batch.exp" where batch is the name of the collection of
      experiments you are interested in.}
  }

\value{
 List containing the following component:
  
  \item{R}{contains the raw red intensities, R.}
  \item{G}{contains the raw green intensities, G.}
  \item{Rb}{contains the background red intensities, Rb.}
  \item{Gb}{contains the background green intensities, Gb.}
  as well as information from other users selected columns information.

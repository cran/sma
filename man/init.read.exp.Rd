\title{Reads the Output of the Computed Statistics}

\description{
  Function displays the 30 measurements computed by the program Spot for
  each gene in the slide being considered.} 

\usage{
init.read.exp(batch, imageid, sep="\t", header=TRUE, ...)}

\arguments{
 \item{batch}{batch name of the experiment}
 \item{imageid}{integer value; the index of the slide which is considered}
 \item{sep}{the field separator character; the columns of the file
 will be separated by this character.} 
 \item{header}{a logical value indicating whether the file contains the
   names of the variables as its first line.}
 \item{\dots}{graphical parameters may also be supplied as arguments to
   the function (see \code{\link{par}}).}
}

\value{
  A matrix containing the 30 columns of computed measurements,
  corresponding to the rows of different genes in the specified
  slide. \cr Details regarding these measurements can be found at
  \url{http://www.cmis.csiro.au/iap/Spot/spotoutput.htm}.}

\examples{
## apoa1.info <- init.read.exp("apoa1", 1) ## obtains the matrix

## experiment.}
